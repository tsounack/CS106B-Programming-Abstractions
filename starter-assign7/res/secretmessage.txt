Hi Evan!

Thank you for all the time you invested in making this course amazing, I feel like I learned many things and I was very happy to have you as a section leader! Your feedback on my assignments always motivated me to try to write cleaner code, and I am very impressed by the fact that each line of code we submit is actually reviewed (I did not expect that given the number of students enrolled). Thank you again for your help and suggestions on finding Software internships during IGs!

Wish you all the best :)
